Solutions for kattis problems

# Goals
We want to solve problems that are atleast 4.5 difficulty or harder. 
Due to kattis's rating system, once hard problems could be lowered to 
a smaller difficulty, but they could increase as well. In rare cases, 
I have encountered problems that are 'easy' but are actually really 
well know problems that are hard. So the rating system is really not 
great at encapsulating problem difficulty.
